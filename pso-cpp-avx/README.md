Trying to "learn" vector procesing with AVX.

[original](https://github.com/r4qq/pso-crazy-man/tree/main/pso-cpp) one.

So i've written simple custom allocator to allocate alligned memory for the avx instructions.
Heavily "inspired" by [this](https://github.com/zhourrr/aligned-memory-allocator/blob/main/aligned_allocator.h).
